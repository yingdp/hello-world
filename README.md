# hello-world

Hi I'm Ying

I'm an ordinary IT technical project manager/team leader. I haven't code since my undergrad. It was 13 years ago. I just would like to see how programming world nowaday, catch up with new technology. I have just finished a Ruby course from codeacademy and would like to do more coding on my work. Hope it is not too late to join the coding community!
